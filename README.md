# A Machine Learning-Based Predictive Analysis System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based predictive analysis system using Python. 
The objective is to analyze data, apply preprocessing techniques, train a predictive model, 
and evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure
- `A Machine Learning-Based Predictive Analysis System.ipynb` – Primary evaluation notebook
- `data.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing (if applicable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. Ensure required libraries are installed

## Notes
The Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) is the primary artifact used for evaluation as per submission guidelines.
